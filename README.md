# New Dataset For StarGan Model
This repository contains code for creation new dataset of face images using wiki and youtube. Python autocropper package was used to crop the faces images from other image obtained from youtube video and wiki  Creation and testing of new dataset for stargan can be found on creating and testing folder with python jupyter notebook describing the whole code and process.  Google survey forms were used for the evalutaion of result got from the new dataset . It can be found under evaluation folder with excel file of response of google form.



# Help us ... 

As part of a mini university group project, we were required to generate data for a model to be run on it. A group of researchers developed a GAN model which can transform images based on a specified feature. We extracted images from Wikipedia and YouTube, cropped them and ran the GAN model on them. In order to evaluate the results, we would like you to complete these short and fun surveys where you will be required to only rate and find images.
